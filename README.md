How to use
----------

Make sure you have Python installed and simply run 'python /path/to/mr_lua.py' in your terminal. If you want to get a little crazy you can pipe into lolcat or even cowsay. You can just clone the repo with git, or you can download the .py file, whatever butters your bread. 

No need to thank me for the absolute genius programming that was needed for this project. Just pay your respects to John Lua.
